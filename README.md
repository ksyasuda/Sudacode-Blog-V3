# Sudacode Website V3

This is the third iteration of my personal website/blog.

I decided, upon learning TypeScript, that it would be a good opportunity to
scrap the old, bloated code that I am currently using for my website.  A fresh
start that would enable me to make the website better, leaner, and allows me to
get experience using TypeScript in a larger project.

## How It's Built

The website uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and __TypeScript__ for the
Front End and __Node.js__ and __Express__ for the Back End.

The about page also features charts provided by __Wakatime__ for my weekly
coding stats, as well as most used programming languages.
