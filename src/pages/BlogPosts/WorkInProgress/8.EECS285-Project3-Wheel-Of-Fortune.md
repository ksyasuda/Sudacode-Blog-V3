In the Fall of 2020, while I was taking EECS 285 (Practical Programming in Java), I was given an assignment to create a slightly modified version of Wheel of Fortune in Java using Swing.

While I am not able to show off any of the code or explain how the game was built, I will be able to show off the finished product and the features of the game.
