## Why Dunst? <a name="why-dunst"></a>

When I first started daily driving Arch Linux with KDE and the i3 window manager, the default KDE desktop notifications worked out of the box and there were no issues.  I was able to configure and style them to my liking.  However, about a month into using it, it stopped working one day and I have not been able to get it working since.

Because of that, I've been searching for an alternative and I landed on dunst.  Dunst is a ___"A highly configurable and lightweight notification daemon"___.  These were the two things that I was looking for in a notification daemon.


## Installation <a name="install"></a>
The installaction process on Arch Linux is very simple.  Simply run the following command as superuser and complete the install.
	
	$ pacman -S dunst

## Configuration <a name="config"></a>

The example configuration file can be found at `/usr/share/dunst/dunstrc`.  And it should be copied over to `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc`.


My `dunstrc` can be found in my [Sudacode-Rice GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice) or directly [here](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice/blob/dev/dunst/dunstrc)

There are many configuration options, but the most important for me were `geometry`, `padding`, `max/max_icon_size` and `urgency`.
